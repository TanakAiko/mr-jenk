# Buy01Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4400/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Media & Images

This frontend consumes image URLs provided by the backend, typically generated by the **media-service** and stored in **Supabase Storage**.

- Product and user entities returned by the API may contain one or more **public media URLs**.
- These URLs already point to Supabase public objects (for example: `https://<project-id>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/media/<uuid>_<sanitizedName>.png`).
- The Angular app simply binds these URLs in templates (e.g. using `<img [src]="product.imageUrl" />`).

There is no direct upload logic in this frontend: all uploads go through the backend API (`/api/media`), which handles validation, storage, and filename sanitization.
